The code behind http://jongani.com/

We're starting to open up the codebase so others can help and run with it. 
We'll accept issue submissions and pull-requests are much appreciated. 
The aim here is a lean mean communication tool built on a simple but solid foundation. 
We're looking to minimize dependancy on third party code, unless its lean, maintainable and does the job well.
